                <h3>Is It Hard To Code?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>No, coding is not hard to learn. Much like any other skill, learning how to code requires time and persistence. The difficulty will depend on the programming language itself and what kind of software you’d like to make.</p>
                <p><br>One of the most common reasons people don’t want to learn how to code is because of the perceived difficulty. Some people start the learning process but stop halfway because they get stuck or find it too difficult to understand. </p>
